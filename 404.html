        ONLY A THIN DIMENSIONAL BARRIER SEPARATES US FROM EVIL.
        THE DARK ZONE IS NOT SEPARATE LIKE TWO DIFFERENT PLANETS.
        IT COEXISTS IN THE SAME SPACE AS OUR UNIVERSE, IN THE SAME TIME...
        BUT THE DARK ZONE HAS NO RULES, <br>NO SENSE, NO ORDER.
        WE GIVE THANKS TO HIS DIVINE SHADOW FOR HIS CEASELESS VIGILANCE,
        PROTECTING OUR UNIVERSE OF LIGHT AND ORDER FROM THE HORRORS AND
        DISORDER OF THE DARK ZONE. WE WORSHIP HIS SHADOW. LONG MAY HE REIGN</small>.

    < h2 id="bgt3">DLC: Dana Lodging Complex<br>
    	(time piece demonstration level)</h2> 
    	<p id="nt">
It has a lot of wood everywhere, it's in the woods, every wall is a wooden panel - everything is about carpentry. Floors are made up of parquet patterns,
the only material that stands out is rusty metal - used on elevator gratings, railings, fencework. Metals are there to remind the player of their backtrack
routes - a glimpse into unreachable future sections. 
<br><br>
Eye key: a must for any haunted hotel or a mansion. Symbology of the keys follows the pattern commonly seen in blood, except with added Tongue and Throat keys.
Player must be able to see those elevator gratings open to new floors - each following less predictable layout rules, a glimpse at the overlapping time frames
is shown with the material used for wallpapers - filthy and ancient ones contrasted against bright and flashy ones, oranges and reds with yellow embroidery.
<br><br>
As you leave the lodging complex, you get a feeling of missing out on something very familiar. A connection, as if a relative had been through here once. 
Maybe it's a glimpse of your own insanity - a reminder of all those imaginary worlds collapsing within... or maybe it's a confirmation of your suspicions: 
a reminder that everyone is willingly participating in their own apocalypse - hoping you would join in on the fun. The world was always gone, and Dana Lodging
Complex is an indication of that world - a dying place in any timeframe. A final curtain for each visitor. An episodic visit - nothing more, nothing less.

    				<p id="line">
	Categories - 	weapprevious/nextweap - rotate categories. 							<br>
			previous/next item - rotate individual items.                                                   <br>
			primary selects an item, secondary changes that item's module.                                  <br>
			(?) each number corresponding to each category                                                  <br>
			(?) pressing a category number canceling/rotating individual items                              <br>
			(?) cancel behavior: escape key, bExtra? waiting for delay is lame, quick method required       <br>
	Relocator	- spot-dependent aptele? lets the player move beyond standard gameplay bounds, acts differently depending on preferred module.		<br>
	Grappling Hook	- module, can tag scripted pawns for pulling (only small masses), pulls the player towards special objects                              <br>
	Timed Spring	- module, similar to keen pogo - controls time with a switch. M1 and M2 combinations allow fast switching                               <br>
	Translocator	- module, traditional ut99 style translocator - relies on bouncing and arc-shaped projectile paths. can telefrag.                       <br>
	Wirelink	- controls doors and lifts, unreliable with locked doors, repurpose blue keys into powerup modules?                                     <br>
	X-Ray Wirelink  - module, lets the player see wiring through walls, puzzle usage. why not rewire things through thin walls?                             <br>
	Defenestrator   - sp. module, de-prioritizes door opening, ***(physx?), must be able to kick pawns out of windows                                       <br>
	Sidearm		- regular glock, up to a dozen rounds (maybe less!) allowed per magazine, capable of dropping a skaarj with two rounds.                 <br>
	Sidearm Magazine Handler, temporary weapon created whenever we use a special reloading action. Required for being able to continue fast reloads.        <br>
	Phasing Weapon	- sci-fi sidearm, fires unique projectiles, but acts relatively the same. Capable of zapping scriptedpawns. Enhancement volume?         <br>
	Black Pack	- sci-fi sidearm, fires unique projectiles that can zap ANYTHING (even the player!) Fires with a nasty high-pitched sound. Bug Tech.    <br>
	Flare Gun	- Traditional flare gun, commonly associated with blood. Acts the same. Uses spraycan fire.                                             <br>
	In the first few HOURS (that's right, hours) of the campaign - Wirelink is referred to as an object only Rachel can use. Eventually, the player can     <br>
	change this dynamic, either by finding their own wirelink or by taking the one from rachel(killable rachel?) This opens a new method of completing	<br> 
	each level, because wirelink is not a weapon - it's a tool. With wirelink, the goal of finding color-coded keys may become obsolete, so to make         <br>
	that less noticeable, i thought of hot wires. Ground wires, neutral wires - are the ones the player can modify. Hot wires are changed by the game.      <br>
      	If a player connects a ground wire with a hot wire, the door locks up - demanding a yellow key.                                                         <br>
      	If a player connects a livewire(exposed wiring?) or neutral wire with a hot one - demand the red key.                                                   <br>
      	If a player connects a neutral wire with a ground wire, they take one step in solving the door puzzle.                                                  <br>
      	Any door puzzle must demand up to 12 correct wire changes, depending on the coloring of each door.                                                      <br>
      	Red doors often have a lot of hot wires, blue doors damand little effort. Yellow doors are yellow.                                                      <br>
      	Another solution that prevents wirelink from opening ALL doors in the game is the difference between keys.                                              <br>
      	You can't wirelink an ancient door that would require a moon key, or an eye key, or a spider key. Another                                               <br>
      	interesting problem introduced with turrets - how much control can we allow over them? Should the player                                                <br>
      	be able to rewire all turrets in the level to be friendly? Would it be unfair to deny that? To answer this,                                             <br>
      	i thought of making fixers a lot more flexible than they were in Fear Effect - a fixer, like a door, has 3                                              <br>
      	color-coded variants. Red fixers are always hostile, but can be rewired, which causes them to shut down.                                                <br>
      	Yellow fixers are more reliable for rewiring into friendly ones, but are useless for actually fixing things.                                            <br>
      	Blue ones are always fixing things, so their rewiring would only cause them to malfunction - hence why they're                                          <br>
      	always friendly to the player, unless rewired by rachel and painted red. Red must signify hostile status. Maybe                                         <br>
      	add green fixers too, for the sake of keeping traditional design.                                                                                       <br>
      	<br>
      	Fixers:                                                                                                                                                 <br>
      	red - prioritize hunting targets down, rockets/grenades/spraycans?                                                                                      <br>
      	blue - tesla projectile, attitude_friendly, equipped with a healthstations?                                                                             <br>
      	green - maybe add a follow segment, doom3 style. hated by 48, bullets only                                                                              <br>
      	yellow - ignore the player, prioritize fixing things, buckshot projectiles                                                                              <br>
