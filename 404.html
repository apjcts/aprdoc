	Project: 	5 Years ago, when I pictured her for the first time. She was not named April Kelli. Her name was Lea 
			Catherine Mayfield (sounds awfully silly, but that's what you get if you play too much Gunpoint like 
			I did) April Kelli sounded like a fitting name. It was <i>cryptic enough</i>) to stay true to the first draft 
			attempts I did while trying to picture the general concept. Original visions of this project 
			were somewhat tacky, with a lot of obvious inspirations hiding themselves beneath the ground. 

			April Kelli was not much of a character - but she certainly had her share of problems. Time Travel 
			plots began developing on their own, almost asking me to include every known time machine out there.. 
			I ended up trying to create a story about <i>avoiding </i>time travel - April ended up traveling a greater 
			distance than most time machines would allow. Sort of like a reach beyond the fourth wall. 
			
			The gameplay demands that you (a protagonist) would always put yourself in danger - which is not 
			something anyone would do without being forced to (hence the readers' need for inciting incidents).
			I needed something believable.. and that something was <i>getting home</i>. April's situation caused
			me to create something I call 'clumsy gameplay strategy' - a term specifically used for describing
			gameplay where players have to rely on dirty tricks to survive each encounter.   
			
	Themes:		Stephen King influence was leaking through the walls, X-Files and Fringe inspirations began to flood 
			the narrative with unanswerable questions: ancient gods being taken hostage by planet-sized insects..
			All this nosense peering through unfinished walls of what I thought would be simple set-pieces ended
			up forming a pattern of conspiratorial layers revealing themselves only after apocalyptic events had 
			occured. 
			
	Core Decay:	I originally planned a simple take on the apocalypse - but I ended up turning it into a setting where 
			apocalypse seems to be the foundation for everything. Time travel used as a prevention method for it, 
			cults being formed as the result of time travel, then the cycle repeating itself with aliens revealing 
			themselves to be old versions of humans. It's a goddamn mess, but it evolved around a simple desire to 
			recreate a 90s tv show, to make it playable, to make the story customizable. It's an ever-building 
			pattern of narratives circling around various thoughts I had over the years.

			I call it plotspace, an idea pool (or a soup) where all the inspiring stuff I see inevitably ends up.
			It was not always like this, I wasn't analytical about it until very recently. My wish to recreate 
			some experience I've felt ages ago was (i thought) just a creative impulse, a thing without concept.
			At one point (again, after playing Dishonored 2) i thought about the concept behind the void - how 
			it allows a narrative to bleed into another narrative. I wrote a couple of notes, called it "Origin".

			Origin inevitably ended up being shelved in favor of something I later called "The Intersection", 
			I even wrote a few songs about it, tried picturing how it would sound like if I were to make a score.
			Parts of this "intersection", interestingly enough, ended up being explored in my entry for the descent.
			The concept is the same as Xen, or Void - some abstract location where all the magic is drawn from. I 
			ended up having to bury it under a few layers of the narrative until I eventually decided to never have
			it mentioned in this version of the work. Why? Because it was kinda irrelevant to the plot. I decided 
			to rewrite it again and now it's more of a conduit between reaching different settings in the plot. It's 
			a literal narrative skeleton - it never shows up the actual story, but it keeps the setting intact.
			
	Workspaces:	It's a funny thing - being original. We often repurpose what we see and change it to our liking.
			I'm doing exactly that while retaining (and developing) some of the source material. Lexx for 
			example never got a proper conclusion, same could be said about a lot of films and shows - They're 
			forcing my hand by opening up so many loose ends everywhere - I kind of HAVE to develop them. April 
			Kelli became something of an archetype - a character that would always find herself hanging off a 
			ledge somewhere after causing a horrible disaster that would leave everyone miserable. A lot of 
			depressing shit was written for this project, so I ended up trying to break up the tone - made it 
			more of a dark comedy. A crossbreed between Blood, Saints Row, Deus Ex, Thief, Dishonored... you 
			know the story - an overstated concept that would blow everyone's mind.. never actually developed. 
			
	Skeleton Array	I thought about all the awesome concepts never developed, how they keep rotting away somewhere. This
			was partially due to my discovery of Fear Effect Inferno. It was a cancelled game from 2003 that i'm 
			sure nobody today would care about.. but I did, and that lack of resolution made me want to explore 
			the glimpses of what i've seen - there was simply too much potential waiting to be used. I ended up
			using my plotspace as a justification for combining every narrative i see into a single work, a work
			that by itself becomes a new genre - a new word in some unseen vocabulary. This is why I wanted to 
			set my stage in a place that does not exist. An island without topology, cities without architects.
			
	Visuals:	Blood-covered sheets of paper scattered across an old office in some ruined building. Cyan lakes and 
			distant forest fires decorating the skyline behind some mountains. Torn concrete, hanging ceiling tiles.
			Yellow waste-disposal bags, cyan radioactive liquids splashed against the solid-gray concrete of some 
			modern-esque factory. Metal sheets and skeleton structures, sharp walls separating one district from 
			another. Woods are full of shiny black mold, with insects often dining on hanging corpses from the 
			trees - lynched people, often wrapped into trashbags. Dry sandstone in some empty river. Ruined halls
			of some castle, where animated metal guards appear to leave dead animals to scare away intruders.
			Fancy parquet, polished wood, non-euclidean libraries full of empty books, fancy hanging lamps,
			wooden and stone arches - bright marble with flattened rocks decorating the walls, human bone carvings
			with hanging entrails and chains, broken-glass traps and trees with poisoned fruit fed by human blood.    
			Abandoned production lines and rainy warehouses with shelves full of broken CRTs. Neat commercial spaces, 
			dead shopping malls. Some analogies: Death Machine, Pumpkinhead, Pet Sematary 2 and Severance.

	April Kelli	The name.. 'Kelly' stood out - and I kept it. This 'Kelly' went through a lot of iterations 
			before I could finally arrive at April. At one point, Kelly was a separate character, then 
			a separate character within April's character - their dynamic became so complicated I had to 
			add a new plotline, just so I could have this protagonist continue being.. a regular person.
			
			Names are important, I learned that mostly by taking trial-and-error approaches to naming things. 
			April Kelli Plotline inevitably caused me to write a few albums with deliberate plotting, though
			each track was relevant to the context - there was too much room for interpretation, so I started
			working on a TC that would try to capture that plotline. April eventually became clearer as the 
			only proper perspective for the player to take. For any character in this story, I try to find a
			name that suits them well - a name that will summarize their entire plotline without ever seeming 
			like something straight out of Ace Attourney. April Kelli doesn't sound like anything in particular,
			and it makes sense for her character to NOT be anything in particular - she's both a medium for the 
			player and a self-guided portrait capable of developing with the story. Her commentary attempts to 
			recapture how I'd see each event in the campaign - and because I'm the one developing the plot, you
			might get an impression that April is someone who knows more than any other player character. 

		       	April is the result of combining a lot of people, myself included. I'd say <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106977">Richard Kimble</a>, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1954347">Kiera Cameron</a>, 
		       	<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4159076">Six</a>, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1119644">Olivia Dunham</a> and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0158552">Prue Halliwell</a>, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1187064">Jess</a> (and many others) played an important role in this composite. 
		       	
<!--	Voices:	       	fuck this, i'll rewrite it later
			I'm proud to say that April is a bit of a tabularasa for the player to immerse themselves, while keeping 
		       	the voice of an outspoken protagonist. It's a tough balancing act - avoiding seams in a player character.
		       	One might think the difference between outspoken and silent is not worth much but there's a goldmine of 
		       	interesting lines delivered. Professional delivery is hard to come by, and using pre-recorded voices from 
		       	some game didn't seem like a huge deal for me personally. The project is freeware and does not rely on 
		       	strict mentioning of any plot elements, but still.. finding something fitting is a tough task. 
		       	
		       	I was curious about how Ethan Winters, an outspoken character, keeps the seamless nature of the immersion.
		       	Why? I asked myself that question when I was considering spoken lines for Joshua (Obviously I couldn't 
		       	voice April, or Rachel). 
		       	
		       	I thought about how FPS characters differ in their line delivery, how Gordon Freeman manages to display 
		       	his character without ever speaking a word, or how Jane Shepard differs from JC Denton. Spoken lines 
		       	(I felt) are as important as the character - having a silent protagonist might seem like an easier fix 
		       	(especially when you have no staff) but having no delivery was something I could NOT allow for April.
			I settled for Erica Luttrell's delivery for Emily Kaldwin, most lines were surprisingly plot-agnostic.
			
			A lot of voices in the game have already been heard in some other game - it's not the most original
			(or even moderately good) way to produce a complicated narrative... but it gets the job done for me.
			
			I also couldn't settle for using AI to voice any of my characters. Funny enough, NOT because I wouldn't 
			do such a thing... but because I happen to live in Russia, and I'm not the kind of person to burn a GPU
			to use a local language model. I'd say a lot more, but I feel too much had already been said about this.	-->
	
	Goals:		There's a bit of a problem with first person shooters - they are fun. April's characterization
			prevents a lot of fun elements from appearing within the gameplay. I could sabotage her story 
			by modulating towards a middle ground - something fun against something important for the story...
			But I settled for a finer middle ground - I thought of a gameplay strategy that involves simpler
			weapon handling, at the expense of more complicated gameplay serving as a foundation for character
			development - the kind of development April shares with the player as a living, breathing conduit.
			April does not have military training, never fired a gun before, has no physical prowess to jump
			around the arena, has to rely on dumb luck to survive - she is the antithesis of an action hero.
			This causes a problem with Unreal's standard gameplay expectations - what good is the game if the 
			player is too slow? How can the game be fun if there's only one round required for each enemy?
			This is where my goals begin to converge - a gameplay fun enough to keep the player in the loop.

			Imagine yourself wandering through a level, your job is to cross a bridge. Point A to point B. 
			In this level, you encounter several enemy types, some of them carry weaponry capable of killing
			you immediately. Now, the focus of the game must be shifted just enough to keep the player engaged.
			How to make the player employ a reliable strategy without falling out of character? Cheating. 
			April Cheats, takes shortcuts - uses random junk if necessary. The goal is.. dead-simple survival.
			This wasn't my concept originally, but April forced me to examine Unreal's scaling more closely.
			Unreal has a bit of a problem with scaling, there's no denying that - but if you make an effort,
			you can make levels appear as if they were modeled exactly the same as they'd be in real life. 

			This was originally our goal with arleen as we were considering TheFirewall/SkaarjInfiltration
			as a concept. My brother had keen interest in recreating accurately-sized unreal environments,
			because NaPali felt huge most of the time for both of us - and we both had played too many 2.5D
			games, which made the lack of density in the environments only more apparent for us. Build may 
			not be a photo-real engine, but it certainly has a flair for letting your imagination wander as
			you travel semi-realistic locations. Doom 2 had a similar atmosphere with earth levels but was 
			never quite good at capturing the realness of any place (i was not aware of gzdoom at the time).

	Names:		There's a great variety of names, and April might appear somewhat generic - so why that name? 
			Before I could effectively judge the scope of this project, April Kelli had a straightforward
			storyline that went along rough ideas. Some ideas eventually got inherited by this project, one
			such idea - was the exaggerated conventionality of naming things. Each name has to have a meaning.
			
	Joshua B :	Each player character is an archetype, a riff on a theme. No relation to Death Stranding...
			While April Kelli represents the player (by providing room for interpretation to show some 
			basic modularity in the plot), Joshua is a literal photo-copy, and he follows a strict pattern 
			of actions: his role in the plot is exactly the same as Mr. X. in X-files (get it?). Mr. X was
			unique for me because of his motivation to survive being a direct contrast to Mulder's original
			(and very much dead) informant. Joshua (i think) knows a lot more than any other character, this
			is where some of the modularity comes in - the player can keep his mouth shut, or let him speak.

		       	So, with regard to his original planning - the more you say to other players, the more heat you 
		       	get for doing so - this makes for an interesting dynamic because it invites more difficulty, though
		       	Joshua is technically the easiest difficulty level a player could choose - I don't think I should 
		       	limit the player's ability to find more challenging levels. I try to keep stuff optional, mostly.

			Joshua was included partially as the result of discussions between my brother and I to include a
			literal archetype into a narrative - an attempt to recreate an actor (in a specific role) as some 
			character the players would eventually encounter. Not exactly a new concept (there was a whole genre 
			of games based on film and tv), but a somewhat complex thing to execute: I mean, I couldn't casually 
			photo-scan Roger Cross and ask him to voice this character now, could I? Despite this, Joshua stayed.
			
			His appearance was modeled after (shocker) Joshua Bridges - a supporting character from <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0160277">First Wave</a>. 
			I decided that his gameplay style should be fast-paced, similar to classic first person shooters. I 
			played a lot of Wolfenstein 2, and I couldn't part with how well it plays, despite being short. 
			Another funny thing about Joshua, this fast-pace change technically made him a playable archetype 
			of a modern boomer shooter. An action hero captured (sometimes literally), with Build-Engine-Trio 
			methodology applied to a new thematic core: a core of the mid-to-late 1990s in film and tv.  

	R. C. Lee:	Rachel 'Cynthia' Lee has a slightly different story. Her character went through a lot of changes,
			and her reliance on Wirelink was not always planned (though she was always somehow related to 
			computers, a lot of her character is inspired by 'IT Crowd' and 'Hackers'). I guess Saints Row
			also took a toll on my imagination, because A LOT of this project was inspired by it. There was
			a character in 3rd and 4th game, an ex FBI agent called Kinzie. She had a grudge against Matt
			Miller, a hacker that you deal with in the third game. Their dynamic inspired an archetype of
			some immoral (not immortal, that's a different story) genius - someone to contrast against the
			main character. Earlier drafts referred to her as Rae. She was originally antagonized, but I took
			her motives away from opposing the main cast by focusing her character mostly on April's research.
			
			At one point April wrote a paper on weaponizing sound - the paper was backed by the local military, 
			Rachel conducted an experiment called 'The Missing Fragments Project' and... a lot of things went 
			wrong (as they always do in sci-fi). The disaster cost Rachel's company a lot of money and people,
			she lost her status as the richest, most respected woman in Hereafter - this event was needed to
			explain her gameplay starting. She is not an actively hostile character, but her difficulty curve
			is higher than Joshua's. She can't rely on conventional firearms because of a fascinating reason: 
			She doesn't want to. It's kinda funny because her campaign is linear, and (maybe) only allows killing.
						
			I think Rae became Rachel around the same time I stole the idea of Wirelink from Gunpoint. The 
			tool was so good, I thought only Rachel would have invented - and here it is. Rachel's invention.
			
	Wirelink:	Wirelink originates from the term 'crossing the wires' and 'crosslink'. Gunpoint might've done 
			it first, but the concept of a door-opener was with me ever since my brother wrote one for me.
			It was a bulky unreal weapon subclass that could open movers. It had several modes, mostly to 
			reflect its nature as a grenade launcher, because that's what I thought of when I was younger.
			We called it JUGWPN, and it was more of a grenade launcher than a door opener. Fast forward 10
			years into the future, and here I am (after playing gunpoint several times) 'inventing' wirelink.

	Genre:		April Kelli Project is not exactly a comedy, it's a black comedy. The biggest inspirations with
			tone are 'Army of Darkness' and 'Addams Family Values' - both films taking a comedy approach to 
			horror. The goal is to walk the line between tragedy and satire, without going too far towards
			mixing them both. 

	Goals:		I tried to make this work as inclusive as possible in terms of IP freedom. April Kelli Project had
			A LOT of inspirations, and the main goal here is to deliver cathartic resolutions to plot questions.
			The work started out as an excercise - I was playing NFS: Most Wanted while listening to Stephen King
			talk about developing a situation where... drumroll - a domestic dispute ends up in a zombie apocalypse.

		       	The zombie part was added by me, the plot was open-ended for the excercise: it made me realize how much
		       	potential there is in developing situations without resolution. 'On Writing' enabled me to see a lot of 
		       	endings differently - I started wondering about characters' lives AFTER the curtain went down.. And THIS
		       	is the second goal of April Kelli - to develop situations on demand, to feature April as the lead in 
		       	each of those situations - to develop her chracter by using a variety of interesting locations. April 
		       	and others try to navigate through an open-ended conclusion - a conclusion that would set any situation
		       	for the next mission pack, depending on how the team wishes to approach the tone, or the setting, or 
		       	even drastic changes in character development - all these things result from Unreal's Modding Openness.

	Modularity:	Unreal's Modding Scene has a unique perspective on how assets are treated in storytelling, the majority
			of creators in this community are driven by a certain consensus - it's not really a set of rules, or a 
			mindset.. it's more of a feeling. It becomes apparent when a modder might break that consensus. In most
			games, replacing or taking assets for granted may not seem like a big deal - but Unreal community has 
			a certain way of treating co-development (and all the resulting workflows therein). The biggest crime 
			in unreal modding - is to modify an asset from the game (for example, Vortex2.unr), and share it online. 

			With that in mind, our development strategies had adopted an open-ended approach to making changes. 
			UCC allows packaging of nearly every asset seen in the game, except MyLeveled Content (temporary assets, 
			stored inside each map) - we try to create a set of tools for mappers to develop their levels easily, 
			and (if there is a demand) we add packaging for assets commonly reused, to allow easy changes later. 
<!--	
	Unique Assets:	Basically, we try to put everything into one package. Everything except static meshes and unique textures.
			It's important to stress the idea of 'unique assets' - they are only used once per map. Now, you might be
			wondering - "once? that doesn't sound good at all!" Relax, we still keep our shared assets bundled with 
			our main package - the size limitations for unreal are surpisingly generous, they potentially allow enough
			material to make dozens of levels - and with that in mind, we really try to treat them as their design
			originally implied - I believe Unreal had only scratched the surface of its potential, while making the
			most significant contribution to the medium. When I look at unreal, I see it as a medium within a system.
			                                                                                                         
	Openness:	Unreal's an Operating System, that shouldn't surprise anyone familiar with UnrealEd. It has a virtual machine, 
			each level can be treated as a playback unit, the editor itself can be modified - Unreal has everything needed 
			for creating a medium - and April Kelli Project provides a platform for that medium.                     

-->	
	Story Inspo:	April Kelli is a character within a modular setting, her role as the protagonist - is to finish the level.
			That's her scope as a character inside a game, but I wasn't initially writing a story about an actor moving
			from point A to point B - I was developing situations that sprung to mind. The first situation was inspired
			by Stephen King, the second - by Stranger Things, the third - by Lost Girl... etc, etc etc.

			All these developments inevitably made inspiration as important as the process of writing the story. I've
			noticed a pattern (i'll admit, a bad pattern) of watching more, playing more - just to find more material.
			April Kelli turned into a bit of an obsession for me - I was trying to find a good reference in everything. 
		       	
		       	Doing this made the plot iterate over itself like a feedback loop - it felt like trying to modify the 
		       	noise between the mic and the speakers. At first, I tried keeping it contained within original bounds.
		       	Eventually I gave up on trying to contain the developments of the plot - I couldn't keep up with it, 
		       	at most - i'd be able to document a few ideas, I was disappointed just how slow I was. I was playing 
		       	catch up with the present moment in the story - while the track towards that moment grew exponentially. 
		       	
			The resulting mess eventually developed into Hereafter. It took me a few years, but I'm glad to have 
			arrived at this version of the setting. All things considered, it makes for an interesting play field.

	Plot:		The plot is you waking up at point A, taking a detour to point C, while moving towards point B. If you're
			clever you might find point D, or even points E, F, G and H - but their presence only enhances the context. 
			April is a character without a story and setting - she's a player character, most of her actions are done 
			by you! So, to keep certain plot points open-ended, I came up with four acts for each episode. You make a 
			big decision at the end of each one, and the game rewards you for in the next segment - by mentioning what
			you chose, who you interacted with, etc etc. The goal varies depending on the map you are in. Everything goes.

	Progression:	See, I just described the plot without ever mentioning it. How smooth is that? The progression of events
			is actually straightforward: April wakes up on Aeolus (large cruise boat), wanders into Hereafter (first the
			coastline, then the docks, then an urban area), then begins her escape from Agenda (one large building). 
			
			That should cover at least a few levels to keep the player engaged during the demo. The retail version 
			(is free, but requires more content, and I only have so many birthdays). Anyway, the retail-retail version
			covers Hereafter, Gateway Lake, Cheyenne, Shipyard and Core. Core levels are buried under the shipyard. As
			for all the other levels, they are located in Hereafter - it's a large island containing all the sublevels.

			From the player's point of view - the game starts with a workspace level (my version of the main menu). 
			They wander into a tutorial, then (once the tutorial is done) they wander into the Ghostwood Demo. Which 
			is pretty simple, it has no stray levels (follows a linear path) and works towards an old boat - where we 
			are given the choice between starting the campaign or staying for a while longer. It's a tiny campaign.

			The choice in itself is meaningless if the player has found everything on the first playthrough. The player 
			can absolutely find everything on the first playthrough, if they are vigilant enough. The linear nature of 
			Ghostwood levels should give the player a sense of being caught in a maze, they must learn to feel comfortable 
			with feeling trapped - this should put them off-balance when they reach Hereafter Regions. The island's 
			progression depends purely on how each player decides to approach the sublevels - they could wander from
			workspace to workspace, or they could try to build themselves a straight path towards the finishing line.

			The intent here was partially driven by demands i felt were necessary for me to enjoy the game. A lot of 
			April Kelli was designed around my personal demands as the player. I wanted a game that would always feel
			new whenever I played it, a game with a well-refined skeleton for anything I might consider later, if needed. 

	Setting:	<!-- Picture it like this - you are walking along the road towards whatever goal you might have - out in the distance,
			you see a landmark that eventually grows into a large pivot around the map, you use it as a guiding tool as you 
			approach certain places within each area you visit. You begin to notice a difference in the environments around 
			you - it's like walking through a series of seamless portals guiding you towards your desired objective, changing
			your enviroment slightly to show discrepancies in continuity itself. It's a common thing for anomalous environments, 
			a seamless transition between this world and the next - too raw		-->
			                                                                        
		       	The world of April Kelli Project was originally much bigger, but I've contained it to only a few places. 
		       	
		       		Hereafter  	-  Takes inspiration from Mt. Purgatory and Island of the Eight Immortals. 
		       				   The most important plotlines run through this area - it's a mix between
		       				   afterlife and real life, a literal dreamworld.. Inhabited by psychopaths.
		       				   
		       				   Hereafter has a capital near the center of the Island, it has rivers, lakes,
		       				   mountains, forests.. all that stuff.. But it doesn't have a way out, or any
		       				   contact with the rest of the world. It presents itself as a real place with
		       				   maps and references to real-world things, it is not connected to our world.
		       				   Think of it as a version of Arcadia, or Hades.. or a combination of both.

		    		Cheyenne Lab	-  This location is a mix between two coinciding references. Cheyenne Facility 
		    				   is a version of Black Mesa, while other locations are inspired by Albuquerque.
		    				   Yes, it's a literal mix between Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul and.. Half-Life.
		    				   Like the originals, the places here refract some Lab Experiment Gone Wrong.

		    				   Unlike Half-Life, you don't see much of the lab (aside from a few levels) and
		    				   the enviroments are mostly in the open - city roads, countrysides, houses, desert.
		    				   These places were chosen deliberately to show the disaster from a domestic angle.
				
				Aeolus, Aeolus 2 - These two ships are taken from Triangle(2009), they both have the same layout, but 
						   have slightly varying appearances. Aeolus 1 looks rotten, abandoned, old, overused. 
						   Aeolus 2 looks fresh, lived-in, barely touched, new. Both levels show the same ship 
						   and serve as a bridge between other sections. Yes, it's a lot like Borealis. It 
						   lets you get around. With Aeolus, the player can travel in time without us having 
						   to break up the game, or pausing to think about which time-period each map is in. 
						   
						   The reason I find this bridge important is because I want to redefine the player's
						   expectation of how time is felt by April. Time travel has been done to death, and the
						   seams between time periods become obvious whenever you use a time machine - Aeolus is 
						   technically a time machine, but it focuses on distracting the player with its theme of
						   repetition. The same theme Triangle developed on. On Aeolus, the concept of time is gone.
						    
				Caledonia 	 - This was my favorite area to think about. Originally it served as a meeting ground for
						   all the characters in the plot, a place for deals to be made, even a temporary HQ for
						   some of the main cast. It eventually changed into a bigger concept within a smaller 
						   setting - from a small town it changed into a single building. 

						   It's a place that changes depending on how you look at it, and it also took some 
						   inspiration from L4D2's Dead Center. I wanted an environment that would feel familiar
						   enough to revisit, but weird enough to explore - an old mall seemed appropriate enough
						   to make such an environment. And my initial attachment to this area only made it more
						   interesting to experiment with generic texturing. I dug through a bunch of photos of 
						   abandoned malls and various clean environments with dark corners - visiting such a 
						   place only once seems like a waste of good potential. So I thought of 'workspaces'.

				Workspaces	 - Any enviroment in the game is a closed circuit: it has a start, and an end. A boring
						   concept, but an important one - it teaches appreciation for linear environments that
						   break the pattern of walking from point A to point B. I was playing Far Cry 3 and I
						   went through a few towers before I ended up continuing the plotline - and, years later, 
						   I thought of how Open World Environments create a sense of being in a large room, while 
						   each level inside those open worlds is nothing more than a smaller room. Screw that.

						   When I thought of workspaces, I was actually trying to solve a problem of having the 
						   main menu presented in the game. I wanted to get rid of all UI elements and the main 
						   menu to make the game feel more seamless (an idea my brother and I shared in our
						   project goals) - and in this game.. I settled for several options: a traditional menu,
						   a workspace level that retains all the functions from the menu, and a custom unreal 
						   console with a less intrusive menu (to allow customization without relying on workspaces). 
			<!--			   
						   todo, inventory levels
						   
						   presented inside the environment, like items and weaponry... seemed more natural for 
						   Unreal's class model. A feature that works! 
						   
						   Unreal handles a lot of things with invisible actors. Sometimes it might spawn a 
						   temporary one while executing a script - but in most cases, it was easier for me 
						   to create actors inside the editor, then change their properties to fit the level. 
						   With workspaces - I no longer have to worry about creating a bunch of clunky UI 
						   elements inside Unreal's already complicated UWindow and UMenu classes, I could 
						   simply create an actor for each of the menu functions - give those actors their 
						   respective models and sounds, then place those actors inside my workspace levels.

						   This also gave me an opportunity to solve another problem I had - revisited locales.
						   Resident Evil and many other games have this thing with saving rooms, you find a safe
						   place and.. save. I wanted to replicate that with April - but UMenu and UWindow already
						   have a system for saving and loading, and having those buttons around undermined the concept.

						   So I thought of creating a custom ini that would avoid the problem and never have the player 
						   open a menu while they play. This required me to supply ALL the menu functions while the 
						   console interface was... not present. Then... drumroll - a menu level! Then I thought of 
						   expanding it beyond one room, I thought of a mansion opening up to a small region - and 
						   whenever you travel to a different region - you run into similar mansions with similar 
						   objects in similar places. A menu that you have to walk towards. What a concept. But it 
						   fit the theme! I mean.. the game already takes place in Purgatory, why not add this? 
						   It's like saving rooms, but with a lot more options present - the player could travel 
						   back and forth... gameplay would begin with you leaving the workspace. I guess playing 
						   Baldur's Gate III didn't help the situation. I just wanted some areas to feel like home.

		       	 In most cases, I had a lot of unrelated plots hanging on a rack - I'd take one and I'd see a bunch of 
		       	scenes connected by that situation. April would usually wander into each situation almost aimlessly. 
		       	Then I thought.. Hey, wait - this is 'The Twilight Zone', but the main character is part of the plot, like 'Columbo'.

	PLAYER TEMPLATES - depending on difficulty, player is given a character-specific set of tags
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
				April Template - no special tags applied. Unforgiving gameplay, infinite saving.                                                        
				Joshua Template - weapon variety tags, fast-paced gameplay, workspace saving.                                                           
				Rachel Template - tool variety tags, slow-paced gameplay, limited saving.                                                               
				Kelli Template - tag customization interface, all characters controlled at once.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	BACKGROUND TEMPLATES - custom flags for plotline variety, varied workspace patterns across 4 acts 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
				April, SWAT Flag - two-handed weapons. JAWS, JAWS:X, JAWS:SX and Modern Vision tags. 
				April, Urban Climb Flag - allows the use of spider-mode, restricts movement accelerators.
				when its done

	ENDURANCE TAGS - ease of movement, less endurance use, more constitution gain, reduction of annoying slow-down effects 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
				Nightmare Vision - activated in the dark while crouched, allows navigating in pitch black (shows disturbing scenery).			
				Beast Vision - scriptedpawns are marked clearly regardless of their shade, visibility or texture.                                       
				Movement Accelerator - exactly what it says on the tin: less friction, higher speed.

	Sound-Proof - every sound you make no longer alerts enemy scripted pawns with a makenoise() call.                                       
	Knight Killer - easily destroy bullet-proof pawns (excluding special pursuers).                                                         
	Bombing Run - (outdoors only) player can signal a nearby VTOL for air support once per sublevel.

	Categories - 	weapprevious/nextweap - rotate categories.

			primary selects an item, secondary changes that item's module.

			(?) cancel behavior: escape key, bExtra? waiting for delay is lame, quick method required       
	Relocator	- spot-dependent aptele? lets the player move beyond standard gameplay bounds, acts differently depending on preferred module.		
	Grappling Hook	- module, can tag scripted pawns for pulling (only small masses), pulls the player towards special objects                              
	Timed Spring	- module, similar to keen pogo - controls time with a switch. M1 and M2 combinations allow fast switching                               
	Translocator	- module, traditional ut99 style translocator - relies on bouncing and arc-shaped projectile paths. can telefrag.                       
	Wirelink	- controls doors and lifts, unreliable with locked doors, repurpose blue keys into powerup modules?                                     
	X-Ray Wirelink  - module, lets the player see wiring through walls, puzzle usage. why not rewire things through thin walls?                             
	Defenestrator   - sp. module, de-prioritizes door opening, ***(physx?), must be able to kick pawns out of windows                                       
	Sidearm		- regular glock, up to a dozen rounds (maybe less!) allowed per magazine, capable of dropping a skaarj with two rounds.                 
	Sidearm Magazine Handler, temporary weapon created whenever we use a special reloading action. Required for being able to continue fast reloads.        
	Phasing Weapon	- sci-fi sidearm, fires unique projectiles, but acts relatively the same. Capable of zapping scriptedpawns. Enhancement volume?         
	Black Pack	- sci-fi sidearm, fires unique projectiles that can zap ANYTHING (even the player!) Fires with a nasty high-pitched sound. Bug Tech.    
	Flare Gun	- Traditional flare gun, commonly associated with blood. Acts the same. Uses spraycan fire.                                             
	In the first few HOURS (that's right, hours) of the campaign - Wirelink is referred to as an object only Rachel can use. Eventually, the player can     
	change this dynamic, either by finding their own wirelink or by taking the one from rachel(killable rachel?) This opens a new method of completing	 
	each level, because wirelink is not a weapon - it's a tool. With wirelink, the goal of finding color-coded keys may become obsolete, so to make         
	that less noticeable, i thought of hot wires. Ground wires, neutral wires - are the ones the player can modify. Hot wires are changed by the game.      
      	If a player connects a ground wire with a hot wire, the door locks up - demanding a yellow key.                                                         
      	If a player connects a livewire(exposed wiring?) or neutral wire with a hot one - demand the red key.                                                   
      	If a player connects a neutral wire with a ground wire, they take one step in solving the door puzzle.                                                  
      	Any door puzzle must demand up to 12 correct wire changes, depending on the coloring of each door.                                                      
      	Red doors often have a lot of hot wires, blue doors damand little effort. Yellow doors are yellow.                                                      
      	Another solution that prevents wirelink from opening ALL doors in the game is the difference between keys.                                              
      	You can't wirelink an ancient door that would require a moon key, or an eye key, or a spider key. Another                                               
      	interesting problem introduced with turrets - how much control can we allow over them? Should the player                                                
      	be able to rewire all turrets in the level to be friendly? Would it be unfair to deny that? To answer this,                                             
      	i thought of making fixers a lot more flexible than they were in Fear Effect - a fixer, like a door, has 3                                              
      	color-coded variants. Red fixers are always hostile, but can be rewired, which causes them to shut down.                                                
      	Yellow fixers are more reliable for rewiring into friendly ones, but are useless for actually fixing things.                                            
      	Blue ones are always fixing things, so their rewiring would only cause them to malfunction - hence why they're                                          
      	always friendly to the player, unless rewired by rachel and painted red. Red must signify hostile status. Maybe                                         
      	add green fixers too, for the sake of keeping traditional design.
